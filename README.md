## Usage

For complete documentation, including how to use Tidecaller, plugin development, and theming, visit the [Tidecaller Documentation](https://riptxde.github.io/tidecaller/).

## Design Philosophy

Tidecaller is designed as a **lightweight, extensible framework** rather than a feature-complete admin script. It ships with a useful set of default commands and focuses on providing an excellent foundation for custom functionality through plugins.

If you're looking for a fully-featured admin script with a comprehensive set of built-in generic exploiting commands out of the box, we recommend checking out [Infinite Yield](https://github.com/EdgeIY/infiniteyield).
